## utility function that converts english type to greek text 

**map english characters to Greek characters:**
each english language character needs to correspond to a unicode value 
the mapping can be done with an Object literal, e.g, `alpha` is:   
```js 
    {
        'a': 945
    }
```
A very basic mapping function would look like this:
```js 

    let e2gMap = { 'a': 945, 'b': 946, 'c': 947 };

    const e2gMapper = ch => String.fromCharCode(e2gMap[ch]);

```
