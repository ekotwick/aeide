home page: select the style of greek you want to work with

next page: select whether you want to write Greek or work with pre-written greek

if write Greek, there's a toggle that will allow you to decide how you want to write Greek (either direct transliteration) or using standard unicode 

the writing will automatically be converted to Greek 

then there will be buttons that will parse and scan the text 

// consider the following option: the greek text appears directly above the text we're writing with the english beneath it (IF transliterating);
