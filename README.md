# Senior Enrichment Project

Make a thing!

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. *Set the name of your project in `package.json`*. The skeleton intentionally ships with an invalid name.
3. `npm install`
4. Check out the mock-view in the `wireframes` folder
5. Start the build process with: `npm run build-watch`
6. In another terminal, start your app with `npm start`
7. If you navigate to the URL you should see some UI already :) [We already have some connection code to get you started]

## Requirements

### The Premise
